# 🛠️ AWS Data Engineering Projects

This document outlines common project types handled by an **AWS Data Engineer**, focusing on designing scalable, efficient, and resilient data systems using AWS services.

---

## 📦 1. Data Warehouse Migration

**Overview**  
One of the most critical and widely implemented project types involves migrating traditional data warehouses (e.g., Teradata, Netezza) to **Amazon Redshift**.

**Key Tasks**
- Convert legacy ETL workflows into AWS-native services
- Migrate user-defined functions (UDFs) into supported languages (e.g., from C to Python/SQL)
- Rewrite SQL queries for Redshift compatibility
- Schedule and automate SQL jobs using orchestration tools

**Skills Required**
- Deep understanding of both source (on-premise) and target (cloud) systems
- Proficiency in SQL, Python
- Experience with Redshift and AWS DMS

## 🌊 2. Building a Data Lake in AWS

**Overview**  
Many enterprises are moving towards building centralized data lakes using **Amazon S3** to store massive historical and real-time datasets.

**Key Tasks**
- Migrate large volumes of data from systems like SQL Server into S3
- Implement **hot vs. cold data** strategy
- Perform **data hydration** to backfill historical records
- Use **AWS Glue** and **Amazon EMR** for transformation and cataloging

**Services Involved**
- Amazon S3
- AWS Glue
- Amazon EMR
- AWS Lake Formation (optional)

## 🔄 3. End-to-End Data Pipelines / ETL Pipelines

**Overview**  
Building scalable ETL pipelines that transform raw data into usable insights using layered architecture.

**Pipeline Example**
1. **Bronze Layer**: Ingest raw data into Amazon S3
2. **Silver/Gold Layer**: Use AWS Glue or EMR for data cleaning and transformation
3. **Analytics Layer**: Store transformed data in Amazon Redshift or query via Athena

**Key Components**
- AWS Glue / EMR for data processing
- Apache Hudi for versioned, incremental processing
- Amazon MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow) for orchestration

## 📊 4. Building Data Marts

**Overview**  
Creating domain-specific data marts in **Amazon Redshift** for business reporting and analytics.

**Key Tasks**
- Data aggregation and denormalization
- Implementing star/snowflake schemas
- Supporting BI tools like QuickSight or Tableau

**Services Used**
- Amazon Redshift
- Amazon QuickSight
- AWS Glue

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Compute & Processing**: AWS Glue, Amazon EMR
- **Storage**: Amazon S3, Redshift, Apache Hudi
- **Orchestration**: Amazon MWAA (Airflow)
- **Transformation**: SQL, Python, Spark
- **Visualization**: QuickSight, Tableau
